            AgileCamp is expanding and growing. We’ve already added one new
            location in 2019&mdash;Chicago&mdash;with even more on the horizon.
            Currently, you can find us in five major locations across the United
            States.
 -->
            Each one-day event will feature industry leaders and Agile experts
            for you to learn from. You’ll be exposed to new ideas, hear from a
            group of diverse thinkers, and be able to put your skills to the
            test with hands-on workshops to help you to sharpen your expertise.
            Afterward, you will leave with all the knowledge you need to
            implement an Agile strategy, grow your business and execute
            invaluable practices.
          </p>
