                    Bratton collects information under the direction of our customers, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes on behalf of such customers. When we provide services to our customers, in some instances we process personal information about their clients or employees (“Client Information”) on their behalf. In these situations, it is our customers rather than we who decide the reasons for which the Client Information will be processed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If you are a client or employee of one of our customers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our customers that use our service or for details of how the Client Information will be used and protected, and details of how to access or correct the information, please refer to the privacy statement of the Bratton customer to which you submitted your personal information. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Bratton acknowledges that you have the right to access your personal information. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete data should directly query Bratton’s customer. If requested to remove data, we will respond within the applicable legal timeframe.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We will retain personal data we process on behalf of our customers for as long as needed to provide services to our customers at their instruction. Bratton may also retain this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

                    Bratton has implemented administrative, technical, and physical measures designed to protect your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, alteration, or destruction. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings, Internet firewalls, anti-virus protection, and, where appropriate and required by applicable law, Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) or similarly encrypted browsers. However, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% private and secure, and you understand that Bratton does not ensure or warrant the privacy or security of any information we collect from or about you, and that you use the Bratton Websites and provide us with information at your own risk. If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Please also be careful to avoid “phishing” scams, where someone may send you an email that looks like it is from Bratton asking for your personal information. Bratton will never request your personal information through e-mail. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at set forth below.
